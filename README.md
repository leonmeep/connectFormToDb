Includes:
  * dynamic working environments

This is a very simple form that allows the site visitor to submit a comment about the site, or about anything really, like a form 
of X (twitter) but the comment is never displayed.

Upon submission it will then be added to a corresponding database.

To further this, I may create a dynamic topical element. Perhaps like taking a poll
